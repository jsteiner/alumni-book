I would ask him about life in America back then and definitely get some pictures of the family. \r\n\r\n**What's one skill that you could teach everyone else in class?**\r\n\r\nInstalling an aftermarket stereo in your car. Or, something that can be done inside: a great card trick that ends in me slapping cards out of your hand and leaving the card you picked.\r\n\r\n**What is the one thing about you that people would be surprised to learn?**\r\n\r\nI am the lead singer in a [band](http://music.twentyeightmusic.com) that has been playing in the Boston area over the last 10 years ... and I am huge fan of karaoke outings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
