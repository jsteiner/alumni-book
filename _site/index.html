      <p>Joseph Campbell. As someone embarking on a journey that will ideally alter my path for the better, I would love to learn and receive guidance from a man that examined who we are at our core and why we seek what we seek. I believe that many (if not all) of us in this program are here because it is the next step in discovering our own path, and I am certainly no different.</p>

      <p>I'd like to have dinner with Winston Churchill. He was an incredibly smart man and a great leader, and I've read that he was quite the jokester as well. We'd have a good dinner, probably some delicious steaks, medium rare, and we'd dine at Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, we'd smoke a cigar and drink whiskey, while discussing the politics of Nazi Germany and WW2 wartime strategies.</p>

      <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
      <p>I would have to choose Hernan Cortes. I read a biography of Cortes and was blown away by his story - he led a small group of Spaniards deep into Mexico to topple the Aztec empire and capture their capital city, which was the largest city in the world at the time. The man was certainly flawed and committed some terrible atrocities, but his sheer audacity, determination and fanatical religious devotion were astounding. It's hard to admire a man like that, but I can't think of a person who would provide more interesting dinner conversation than Cortes.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the one thing about you that people would be surprised to learn?</strong></p>
      <p>Despite being clumsy and artistically-challenged, I'm quite crafty.  My kids and I have made over 50 duct tape wallets and have knit dozens of hats/scarves/slippers.  We make origami Christmas tree ornaments and Halloween costumes every year. Just don't ask me to draw.</p>

      <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has done everything. He revolutionized weight lifting. He is a successful actor. He is a lucrative business man. And he served 8 years as a politician. I cannot imagine anyone who has experienced and done that much variety in their lives.</p>

      <p>I would have dinner with Chotoku Kyan. Mr. Kyan was one of the greatest Okinawan masters and standing at 4'9 and a hefty 90lbs reportedly never lost a fight. He was also known for being kind and generous. Mr. Kyan is said to have died from starvation after the Battle of Okinawan due to giving his food to hungry children.</p>
