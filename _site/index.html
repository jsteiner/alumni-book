          <p>Joseph Campbell. As someone embarking on a journey that will ideally alter my path for the better, I would love to learn and receive guidance from a man that examined who we are at our core and why we seek what we seek. I believe that many (if not all) of us in this program are here because it is the next step in discovering our own path, and I am certainly no different.</p>

          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>I'd like to have dinner with Winston Churchill. He was an incredibly smart man and a great leader, and I've read that he was quite the jokester as well. We'd have a good dinner, probably some delicious steaks, medium rare, and we'd dine at Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, we'd smoke a cigar and drink whiskey, while discussing the politics of Nazi Germany and WW2 wartime strategies. </p>

          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>I would have to choose Hernan Cortes.  I read a biography of Cortes and was blown away by his story - he led a small group of Spaniards deep into Mexico to topple the Aztec empire and capture their capital city, which was the largest city in the world at the time.  The man was certainly flawed and committed some terrible atrocities, but his sheer audacity, determination and fanatical religious devotion were astounding.  It's hard to admire a man like that, but I can't think of a person who would provide more interesting dinner conversation than Cortes. </p>

He was fearless, calculated, and a wizard with his words in the geo-political arena.  Surely a person with that much clout would serve as a great dinner guest. </p>

          <p><strong>What's your favourite movie?</strong> Shawshank Redemption </p>
          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>I have been really deep into an Ancestry.com hole as of late and would love to meet my great grandfather from Ireland. I would ask him about life in America back then and definitely get some pictures of the family. </p>
          <p><strong>What's one skill that you could teach everyone else in class?</strong></p>
          <p>Installing an aftermarket stereo in your car. Or, something that can be done inside: a great card trick that ends in me slapping cards out of your hand and leaving the card you picked.</p>
          <p><strong>What is the one thing about you that people would be surprised to learn?</strong></p>
          <p>I am the lead singer in a <a href="http://music.twentyeightmusic.com">band</a> that has been playing in the Boston area over the last 10 years ... and I am huge fan of karaoke outings.</p>
