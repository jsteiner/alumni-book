As someone embarking on a journey that will ideally alter my path for the better, I would love to learn and receive guidance from a man that examined who we are at our core and why we seek what we seek. I believe that many (if not all) of us in this program are here because it is the next step in discovering our own path, and I am certainly no different."

  favourite_person: "I'd like to have dinner with Winston Churchill. He was an incredibly smart man and a great leader, and I've read that he was quite the jokester as well. We'd have a good dinner, probably some delicious steaks, medium rare, and we'd dine at Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, we'd smoke a cigar and drink whiskey, while discussing the politics of Nazi Germany and WW2 wartime strategies."

  favourite_person: "I would have to choose Hernan Cortes. I read a biography of Cortes and was blown away by his story - he led a small group of Spaniards deep into Mexico to topple the Aztec empire and capture their capital city, which was the largest city in the world at the time. The man was certainly flawed and committed some terrible atrocities, but his sheer audacity, determination and fanatical religious devotion were astounding. It's hard to admire a man like that, but I can't think of a person who would provide more interesting dinner conversation than Cortes."
